# Dental Update Interface

This project is related to the [Dental Update project](https://github.com/crispymcbacon/dental-update). This is a Svelte interface for using the Dental Update API and for manually annotating dental images.

For now only the segmentation and manual annotation functionality is available.

## Quickstart

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install # or pnpm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file and add the following line:

```
VITE_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev # or pnpm run dev
```

4. To use the segmentation functionality run the development server and navigate to the segmentation page. The manual annotation does not require the server to be running.

## How to Use

TODO.
